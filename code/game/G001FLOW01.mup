The end result should be as such:</div><div><br></div><div>Actions</div><div>&nbsp; For each (Integer A) from 1 to (Number of players in (All players</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; controlled by a User player)), do (Wait ____ seconds)</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Character Selection</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>&nbsp;_______________</div><div>| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Frequently, RPGs begin with trigger-based character</div><div>| x &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; x | selection.

Okay, to explain. Leaderboards</div><div>have a glitch where they won't work in a Map Initialization trigger.</div><div>That's why they must be placed in a trigger that goes off about as</div><div>soon as the game starts. I used a For command just for sake of being</div><div>original, because most leaderboards are very similar. If it does not</div><div>work, I guess I'll just change it back to a regular command.</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Shaking the Camera</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>To make the camera shake (like when Archimonde summons Infernals), you</div><div>can use two actions: Camera - Sway Camera Source or Camera - Sway</div><div>Camera Target. The Source action will make the camera itself move</div><div>around while still focusing on the center of the map, while the Target</div><div>action will make the camera's focus on the center continue to stutter.</div><div>To stop either command, you can use the Camera - Reset Game Camera or</div><div>Camera - Stop Swaying Camera commands. The preset values for both the</div><div>Target and Source commands are reasonable, and adjusting them</div><div>significantly are unnecessary.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Manipulating the Camera Properties</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>There are many functions that players may wish to change about the</div><div>current camera. While you can use cinematic control by creating</div><div>cameras at specific points and then used the Camera - Apply Camera</div><div>Target (Timed) action, you may also want to adjust the camera's zoom</div><div>or angle of attack at any point in the game.</div><div><br></div><div>To do this, you should take your own look at the Camera actions. A</div><div>particularly useful action is the Camera - Set Camera Field (Timed)</div><div>action.</div><div><br></div><div>Distance to target - Each camera focuses on one specific point. By</div><div>&nbsp; adjusting this, you can zoom in or out. Initial value is 1650.</div><div>Far Z - This determines how far the camera will see. Increasing the</div><div>&nbsp; distance visible will slow down the game somewhat. Only adjust this</div><div>&nbsp; for cinematics, as you really shouldn't need it otherwise.</div><div>Angle of attack - This determines the angle at which the camera looks</div><div>&nbsp; at the point. 0 or 360 is a completely level viewpoint, 270 is</div><div>&nbsp; birdseye view. 304 is the initial value.</div><div>Field of view - This can also be used as a zoom function. However, it</div><div>&nbsp; is preferable to use the Distance to target field.</div><div>Roll - This determines how tilted the camera is. By setting this to</div><div>&nbsp; 180, you can turn the camera upside-down. Initial value is 0.</div><div>Rotation - This shows how much the camera is rotated relative to its</div><div>&nbsp; focal point. The camera originally faces north with a value of 90.</div><div>&nbsp; 180 is west, 270 is south, 0 or 360 is east.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Making Destructible Doodads Drop Items</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>One of the most interesting aspects of the campaigns was the dropping</div><div>of items upon the destruction of certain props (i.e. boxes, huts,</div><div>and the like). To the dismay of beginning editors, there is no easy</div><div>way to make a doodad drop an item like most units. That's because it</div><div>is entirely trigger-based. As an example, assume BOXDOODAD is a</div><div>specific box on the world map. When BOXDOODAD dies, I want it to drop</div><div>a Tome of Experience.</div><div><br></div><div>Functions Used...</div><div>Destructible Doodad - Destructible Doodad Dies</div><div>Item - Create [for the second field, use Destructible Doodad -</div><div>&nbsp; Position of Destructible]</div><div><br></div><div>Events</div><div>&nbsp; BOXDOODAD &nbsp;dies &nbsp;</div><div>Actions</div><div>&nbsp; Create Tome of Experience at (Position of (Dying destructible</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; doodad))</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Accelerating/Decelerating Night and Day</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>If you want to slow down/speed up the rate of night and day, you can</div><div>use the Game - Set Time Of Day Speed. To stop the daily cycle, you can</div><div>use the Game - Turn Day/Night Cycle On/Off. If you want this to take</div><div>effect for the entire duration of the map, then put this action in the</div><div>Melee Initialization trigger.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Making Creeps Sleep</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>You may want creeps, for some reason or another, to be asleep. This</div><div>only requires one action, but it's fairly simple.</div><div><br></div><div>If you want EVERY creep to go to sleep during the day, use the</div><div>Unit Group - Pick Every Unit In Unit Group And Do Action command in</div><div>conjunction with the Unit - Make Unit Sleep one and place it in the</div><div>Melee Initialization trigger...</div><div><br></div><div>Unit Group - Pick every unit in (Units owned by Neutral Hostile) and</div><div>&nbsp; do (Unit - Make (Picked unit) Sleep when unprovoked)</div><div><br></div><div>If you want only specific units to sleep, use the Unit - Make Unit</div><div>Sleep command and do that again for each specific unit you want it to</div><div>affect and place it in the Melee Initialization trigger.</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Basic Commands</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Do Nothing</div><div><br></div><div>This is usually used in conjuction with the If/Then/Else commands. It</div><div>does nothing at all, which is useful when combined with an If command.</div><div>If you don't want anything to happen if the If command is not</div><div>satisfied, you can just place a Do Nothing action in the Else field.</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Comment</div><div><br></div><div>This has absolutely no effect on the game at all. It is merely</div><div>useful for explaining what the nearby actions do. This can be</div><div>helpful for people to learn from your own map, or even to</div><div>remember what complex actions are used for.</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Wait</div><div><br></div><div>Purpose:</div><div>Never use this command in multiplayer. Different computers can react</div><div>differently to this command, and it can set triggers off-balance.</div><div><br></div><div>Otherwise, the Wait command can be used to wait a specified number of</div><div>seconds so that commands are more spaced-out. This is used frequently</div><div>in cinematics.</div><div><br></div><div>Fields:</div><div>2.00 = You can adjust this in order to specify the number of seconds</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;that your computer will wait.</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Wait For Sound</div><div><br></div><div>Purpose:</div><div>This command, similar to the Wait command, can be used to make</div><div>sure a sound finishes before an action is commenced. As an</div><div>advanced use, it can be adjusted so that actions occur at a</div><div>specific point during a sound. Note, however, that this does</div><div>not work with in-game music.</div><div><br></div><div>Fields:</div><div>(Last played sound) = Can't be changed.</div><div>2.00 = Adjust the number of seconds of wait time.</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Set Variable</div><div><br></div><div>Purpose:</div><div>Arguably the most important command in RPG-making, this allows you to</div><div>set the basic variables in your game. I will run down the most used:</div><div><br></div><div>Integer = This is mainly used for If/Then/Else commands. This cannot</div><div>&nbsp; be used to trigger events, though, and I would recommend using</div><div>&nbsp; a Real variable unless you plan to base the variable on random</div><div>&nbsp; integers.</div><div>Real = For all functions that do not require integers, such as</div><div>&nbsp; specifying the values in arrays or random integers, you should</div><div>&nbsp; use real variables. These can be used to satisfy events, and are</div><div>&nbsp; thus vital to setting off events through the use of a variable.</div><div>Timer = This is necessary for creating multiplayer RPG-type maps. By</div><div>&nbsp; utilizing a timer, you can eliminate the necessity of mistimed</div><div>&nbsp; Wait functions.</div><div>Unit = In RPGs, players often have one character. One method of</div><div>&nbsp; tracking these characters is by creating a Unit Array. By using</div><div>&nbsp; Unit[PLAYERNUMBER] = PLAYERCHARACTER, you can make sure you can</div><div>&nbsp; always identify the correct units during cinematics as well as</div><div>&nbsp; even boss battles.</div><div>Unit-Type = This can also be used to track units by their type.</div><div>&nbsp; When selling weapons, you can use this to identify what type of</div><div>&nbsp; weapons that character can buy.</div><div><br></div><div>Fields:</div><div>Variable = Here you can select the appropriate variable. Mathematical</div><div>&nbsp; operators are only useful when dealing with numeric values.</div><div>Value = Here you set the value of the variable. If you want to do</div><div>&nbsp; basic arithmetic, such as increasing the variable by one, you can</div><div>&nbsp; use something like VARIABLE = (VARIABLE + 1.00). To multiply by two,</div><div>&nbsp; you can use VARIABLE = (2 x VARIABLE). As long as you are good at</div><div>&nbsp; basic math, these should pose no problem. Note, however, that this</div><div>&nbsp; can be used for incredibly advanced formulas. You can't teach this,</div><div>&nbsp; and you can only learn this type of math through experience.</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Skip Remaining Actions</div><div><br></div><div>Purpose:</div><div>This should also be used in conjunction with If/Then/Else commands.</div><div>The best use would be that if the \"If\" condition is not satisfied, you</div><div>can skip the remaining actions. This way, you can avoid any undue</div><div>cinematics, bonuses, or the like.</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>If/Then/Else</div><div><br></div><div>Purpose:</div><div>If the \"Condition\" field is not satisfied, the first \"Action\" field is</div><div>performed. Otherwise, the second \"Action\" field is performed. Most</div><div>often, the Condition will be either a Boolean Comparison or a variable</div><div>comparison. Examples are as follows:</div><div><br></div><div>Boolean Comparison</div><div>&nbsp; ((Triggering unit) is A structure) Equal to True</div><div>Player Comparison</div><div>&nbsp; (Owner of (Triggering unit)) Equal to Player 1 (Red)</div><div>Unit-Type Comparison</div><div>&nbsp; ((Unit-type) of HERO) Equal to Tauren Chieftain</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Animation - Play Unit Animation</div><div><br></div><div>Purpose:</div><div>This can play the animation of a specified unit once. If you want a</div><div>unit to do a victory pose or pretend to attack, you can use this. To</div><div>find the appropriate animation, use the Unit Layer and find the right</div><div>unit, and then look at the little box on the left of the WE that</div><div>shows the unit's model. Here, you can find the different animations</div><div>available. You can then type the string in to the function. For</div><div>example, if you want to play the peasant's \"stand - 3\" animation, the</div><div>function should look like so:</div><div><br></div><div>Animation - Play PEASANT 's stand - 3 animation</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Animation - Change Unit...</div><div><br></div><div>These can adjust the model's values for specific characteristics.</div><div>They will be discussed in greater detail in the Unit section of the</div><div>FAQ.</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Environment - Create Weather Effect</div><div><br></div><div>Purpose:</div><div>If you want there to be snow, rain, sunlight, etc. you can use this.</div><div>You are given a wide amount of weather effects to choose from, and</div><div>they can all add a lot of style to your map. They do slow system</div><div>performance, so make sure they are used sparingly.</div><div><br></div><div>Fields:</div><div>(Playable map area) - You can specify the region in this field. It is</div><div>&nbsp; recommended that you use pre-made regions, or do not adjust this</div><div>&nbsp; area at all. Note, though, that you can create region-specific</div><div>&nbsp; weather effects by double-clicking on a region with the Selection</div><div>&nbsp; Brush enabled.</div><div>Ashenvale Rain (Heavy) - You can select the weather effect here.</div><div>&nbsp; They can all be very neat, but you must remember not to have too</div><div>&nbsp; much going on at the same time. The fog effect can actually</div><div>&nbsp; enhance performance somewhat, while effects like wind will really</div><div>&nbsp; bog down your computer.</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Environment - Set...</div><div><br></div><div>The Set Sky and Set Fog commands are both self-explanatory. In fact,</div><div>the Sky function is very similar to the Weather Effect function.</div><div>The fields below are for the Set Fog function.</div><div><br></div><div>Fields:</div><div>0 = This shows the fog style. Values range from 0 to 2</div><div>1000.00 and 8000.00 = These are the beginning and end points of the</div><div>&nbsp; fog, respectively.

This</div><div>guide was written in the hopes that I can start you off on your camera-</div><div>working skills.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Sections</div><div>1. Starting Off</div><div>2. Camera Properties</div><div>3. Camera Movement</div><div>4. Camera Triggers</div><div>5. Optional Camera Triggers</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Starting Off</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>First off, I'll try to explain the two basic layers that go into</div><div>making a full cinematic. &nbsp;The first thing you will need to place is a</div><div>Camera, which can be found in the Camera Layer (the top menu bar in</div><div>the World Editor has a Layer section, pull it down and select Camera).</div><div>You can't create a movie without using cameras, can you? &nbsp;Don't worry</div><div>about the specifics just yet, I'll get into more detail on that later.</div><div><br></div><div>Start off by placing three cameras, side by side. &nbsp;Do this by opening</div><div>up the Camera Layer. &nbsp;A screen should pop up on the right side of the</div><div>map, with three selections, Create Camera, View Selected Camera, and</div><div>Set Camera to Current View. &nbsp;Right now, just worry about Create Camera.</div><div>Select it, and a blue, semi-translucent camera should appear in front</div><div>of the screen.</div><div><br></div><div>Move the screen around a little and you will see how the camera looks.</div><div>Basically, it looks like a regular movie camera, with an arrow</div><div>pointing towards the ground. &nbsp;The area that arrow is pointing to is</div><div>what the screen will be centered on when the movie actually plays, or</div><div>what I call, the target. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You can move the camera around into a better spot with your mouse,</div><div>which is the prefered way. Now, you may have noticed by now that you</div><div>can't have the camera facing other directions, or move closer to the</div><div>ground. &nbsp;To fix this, double click the camera, and a Properties screen</div><div>should pop up.</div><div><br></div><div>Camera Properties</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Several selections are availiable in this screen, I'll explain them.</div><div><br></div><div>Camera Name:</div><div><br></div><div>Camera Values:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Target X - See below</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Target Y - See below</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Z Offset - These three selections are used to move the camera from</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; wherever it is right now.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Increasing the X value will move the camera to the right,</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; increasing the Y value moves it upward and the Z Offset affects</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; how far off the ground the camera will be.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Rotation - This affects what angle the camera will be facing. &nbsp;The</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; values that can be used here are from 0 to 360. &nbsp;Making it 0</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; points the camera right. &nbsp;180 makes it point left. 90 points up,</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; and 270 points downward. &nbsp;This is one of the most important</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; selections availiable for the camera.*</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Angle of Attack (AoA) - This is also a very useful tool, as it</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; changes how far from the ground the camera is. &nbsp;The higher the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; value (like the Rotation, the values can be from 0 to 360), the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; lower to the ground it will be. &nbsp;Making it 360 puts the camera</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; completely on the ground, whereas 10 makes it actually go under</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; the ground.*</div><div><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"><span style=\"white-space: normal;\">\t\t</span></span></div><div>&nbsp; Distance - This is how far from the target the camera will be. &nbsp;The</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; higher the value, the farther away the camera will be, and the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; smaller everything will look when the cinema plays.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Roll - This gives the camera a nice tilting affect. &nbsp;This tends to</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; add an air of suspense to the movie. You've probably seen a movie</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; where the camera tils to one side during a suspenseful part. The</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; higher the value here, the more it will tilt to the right. Like</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; the Distance and the AoA, the values here can be from 0 to 360.*</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Field of View (FoV) - This is, essentially, the zoom. &nbsp;The higher</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; the value, the farther away you will see from. &nbsp;The lower the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; value, the closer to the ground you will see on your screen.</div><div><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"><span style=\"white-space: normal;\">\t\t</span></span></div><div>&nbsp; Far Clipping (FarZ) - Don't worry about this one yet. &nbsp;It doesn't</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; really apply to the basics of camera working, so I'll leave it</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; out for now.</div><div><br></div><div>*Notice how many of the values can only be from 1 to 360? &nbsp;Think of</div><div>these as a circle. &nbsp;The very top of the circle is both 0 and 360 (they</div><div>are the same thing). &nbsp;If your still stumped, think of it as a clock. &nbsp;</div><div>When it is 3:00, that is both 0 and 360. &nbsp;270 would be 6:00, 180 would</div><div>be 9:00, and 90 would be 12:00. &nbsp;If you are still stuck (completely</div><div>understandeable), I'll have several examples at the bottom of the&nbsp;</div><div>Cinematics section that may help you.</div><div><br></div><div>All right. So hopefully, you now know how to place a camera and make</div><div>the zoom, tilt, angle, whatever, to your liking. &nbsp;If you do, please</div><div>place a few cameras and try adjusting their properties to get the hang</div><div>of it. &nbsp;If you don't understand, I'll have a few examples towards the</div><div>end of the Cinematics section that may help you (have I said that</div><div>already O_o?).</div><div><br></div><div>Remember how I told you to create three cameras, side by side? &nbsp;Have</div><div>the cameras point towards a singular object (preferably a unit of some</div><div>kind). &nbsp;Have one pointing straight forward at it (the Rotation would</div><div>be 90), one pointing to the right side of the unit (the Rotation would</div><div>be 180), and one pointing to the back of the unit (270).</div><div><br></div><div>Camera Movement</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Now, before you can understand where to place the cameras, you need to</div><div>know how they work. When you create and complete the triggers for the</div><div>respective camera (you have to create quite a good deal of triggers,</div><div>but I'll explain those later), the screen will move from one camera to</div><div>the next in as straight a line as possible. &nbsp;You should have three</div><div>cameras already created, facing one unit. &nbsp;Once you have the triggers</div><div>up, it will move from the 1st camera (the one facing north), to Camera</div><div>2 (the one facing the units right side), then to Camera 3 (the one</div><div>facing the unit's back).</div><div><br></div><div>The end result of the triggers and cameras working together will have</div><div>the screen revolve around the unit starting at its front, to its side,</div><div>then its back.* &nbsp;But don't worry about the triggers yet, this is just</div><div>to explain how the cameras will move when they are done, as to help</div><div>you know where to place them.</div><div><br></div><div>*When I say back, I don't neccesarily mean the actual back of the unit.</div><div>Unless you change the unit's Facing Degree, chances are, the camera</div><div>probably won't actually be facing it's back/front/side when I say it</div><div>will. Just imagine that the unit the cameras revolve around is facing</div><div>south (facing the bottom of the screen).</div><div><br></div><div>I'd like to make one last note before I finish the Movement section.</div><div>Chances are, you are probably feeling a bit confused right now. Don't</div><div>worry. &nbsp;Just wait until I talk about the triggers, because that's when</div><div>I'll start giving examples where you can make your own cinematics,</div><div>which should clear up any confusion.</div><div><br></div><div>Camera Triggers</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>All right, now we get into the fun stuff. &nbsp;I'm assuming you have the</div><div>cameras placed and in position, because the cinematic won't work right</div><div>if they aren't. &nbsp;For explanation purposes, please place the three</div><div>cameras with their respective property adjustments as I have mentioned</div><div>before.</div><div><br></div><div>First off, let me explain why you need the triggers. &nbsp;The cameras will</div><div>not simply move by themselves. &nbsp;You need to specify when and how they</div><div>will move, and you do that by using triggers. &nbsp;If you are a complete</div><div>beginner in the ways of triggers, I suggest you read more about it in</div><div>that section of this FAQ. &nbsp;Things could become a bit confusing</div><div>otherwise.</div><div><br></div><div>With that out of the way, we can begin. &nbsp;Open up the Trigger Editor</div><div>from the Module menu at the top. &nbsp;I suggest creating a new category</div><div>for the cinematics. &nbsp;For the FAQ purposes, I'll name it Cinematics</div><div>(create a new category by clicking New at the top, and selecting</div><div>Category). &nbsp;Now, create a new trigger (same way as the category, only</div><div>select Trigger), and name it whatever you feel like (I'll be naming&nbsp;</div><div>the example, Cinematic 1). &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>When the trigger comes up, you will see three things, Events,</div><div>Conditions, and Actions. &nbsp;I won't go into great detail about these,</div><div>because this is the Cinematics section, not the Triggers. &nbsp;But for general&nbsp;</div><div>purposes, the Event is what will cause the trigger to occur (such</div><div>things as Map Initialization and Unit Entering a Region), the</div><div>Conditions are specific things that are used to further adjust when the</div><div>trigger happens, and the Action, which is what occurs when the Event is</div><div>reached. &nbsp;</div><div><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"><span style=\"white-space: normal;\">\t</span></span></div><div>First, I suggest you make the event Map Initialization (from here on,</div><div>I will assume you have read at least some of the Trigger section, to</div><div>save myself time). &nbsp;Don't bother with conditions right now. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Before I continue, I'd like to make a note of some of the Actions you</div><div>will be using to make the cinematics.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Basically anything in the camera category is of use here</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; (of course), but most importantly, Camera - Apply Camera Object.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is what causes the screen to move to the camera.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Cinematics - This category is of obvious use also. &nbsp;The main</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; triggers here you will be using are Transmission from Unit and</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Cinematic Mode. &nbsp;They are all pretty obvious, and add nice touches</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; to any cinematic. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Transmission from Unit&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is when the units head appears at the bottom left of the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; screen and speaks to you (in the Single Player Missions you hear</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; their voices from Voice Actors, when online, you will only see</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; text). &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Cinematic Mode&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This changes the screen to make it more of a movie feel. &nbsp;All of</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; the cinematics in the single player use Cinematic Mode. &nbsp;It is of</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; great use, and should probably be placed at the start of any</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Camera trigger. &nbsp;Probably the most important uses of this is that</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; it gets rid of Fog of War while the Cinematic is playing, which</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; makes it so you can actually see what's going on. [Ed: It also</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; removes user control.]</div><div><br></div><div>Please note, those are only the very basic triggers for working with</div><div>cameras. &nbsp;There are many, many more. &nbsp;This section was written just so</div><div>you can start on your way to cinematic making.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, you should have a trigger open, named whatever you chose</div><div>(remember, mine is Cinematic 1). &nbsp;You should also have the event be</div><div>Map Initialization. &nbsp;Once you have all of these down, you can start&nbsp;</div><div>placing the Actions. Start by placing a Cinematic - Cinematic Mode.</div><div>This is always a good place to start for any cinematic, for the</div><div>reasons I have written above.</div><div><br></div><div>Just to specify, their are a few options you can change in</div><div>Cinematics - Cinematic Mode. &nbsp;They are On and (All Players). &nbsp;Both are</div><div>quite obvious, but for general reference, from now on, I will begin&nbsp;</div><div>addressing triggers in this manner.</div><div><br></div><div>Here is what the trigger should look like:</div><div><br></div><div>Actions</div><div>&nbsp; Cinematic - Turn Cinematic Mode On for (All Players)</div><div><br></div><div>Now, place a Unit - Pause/Unpause All Units event. &nbsp;This causes all of</div><div>the units to stop doing everything, including attacking, moving,</div><div>whatever. &nbsp;The trigger will look like this:</div><div><br></div><div>Actions</div><div>&nbsp; Cinematic - Turn Cinematic Mode On for (All Players)</div><div>&nbsp; Unit - Pause all units</div><div><br></div><div>The pause condition [Editor: In other sections, this may be referred</div><div>to as the \"field\".] (that is what I call any part of an event,</div><div>condition, or action that can be changed) can be changed from pause to</div><div>unpause. &nbsp;The reason you have this is Action here is so that the units</div><div>won't attack each other while the cinematic is playing. &nbsp;This doesn't</div><div>have to go right in the front, I just have placed it there for ease</div><div>in explanation. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The next, and probably most important Action to place is the</div><div>Camera - Apply Camera Object (Timed). &nbsp;It will look like this once you</div><div>have placed it:</div><div><br></div><div>Actions</div><div>&nbsp; Cinematic - Turn Cinematic Mode On for (All Players)</div><div>&nbsp; Unit - Pause all units</div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Apply CAMERA1 &nbsp;for Player 1 (Red) over 5.00 seconds.</div><div><br></div><div>And here are the conditions you can change in it.</div><div><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\" style=\"white-space:pre\"><span style=\"white-space: normal;\">\t\t</span></span></div><div>&nbsp; Apply - This can either be Apply, which means move to over how long</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; you chose in the seconds condition, or Apply without panning,</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; which means just go straight there.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; CAMERA1 - This is where you select which camera to move to. &nbsp;If you</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; named the cameras the way I suggested, then CAMERA1 should be the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; first one you place.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Player 1 (Red) - This is where you select which players will see the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; camera movement. &nbsp;It may get tedious to have to create a new</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Camera - Apply Camera Object for each player, so there is a way to</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; have each player in the game see it. &nbsp;Refer to the Extras section</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; for that Action.</div><div><br></div><div>[Editor: Here's the correct method, verbatim...</div><div><br></div><div>Functions Used...</div><div>Player Group - Pick Every Player In Player Group And Do Action</div><div>Camera - Apply Camera Object (Timed)</div><div><br></div><div>Actions</div><div>&nbsp; Player Group - Pick every player in (All players) and do (Camera -</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Apply CAMERA1 &nbsp;for (Picked player) over ___ seconds)</div><div><br></div><div>Make sure this is all one function, and that you change the</div><div>\"Player 1 (Red)\" portion of the Apply Camera part to \"Picked Player\".]</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; 5.00 - This is where you choose how long the camera will move from</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; one to the next. Because you are starting with the first camera</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; (you aren't going to be moving from one fixed camera to the next,</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; so each player's screen will probably be on different parts of the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; map), this effect won't be the same for each player. &nbsp;Say one</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; player's screen is on the other side of the map from where you</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; placed the camera. &nbsp;Their screen will move from their position to</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; the camera in 5.00 seconds (or however long you have chosen).</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; That would be a big difference from someone who has their screen a</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; foot away from the camera. &nbsp;Their screen will move very slowly to</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; get to the camera in 5 seconds, whereas the person with their</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; screen on the other side of the map will move rapidly to the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; camera. Try to keep that in mind when you chose this condition.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; [Editor: A possible solution is to apply a camera for all players</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; at the beginning of the cinematic trigger for 0.00 seconds, so all</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; players have the exact same viewpoint as the cinematic starts.]</div><div><br></div><div>Place the Camera - Apply Camera Object and adjust its properties to</div><div>your liking. &nbsp;For explanation purposes, I will use the cameras you</div><div>should have placed around the unit already. &nbsp;Thus, the Action should</div><div>read:</div><div><br></div><div>Actions</div><div>&nbsp; Cinematic - Turn Cinematic Mode On for (All Players)</div><div>&nbsp; Unit - Pause all units</div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Apply CAMERA1 &nbsp;for Player 1 (Red) over 5.00 seconds</div><div><br></div><div>If you have placed these first three Actions correctly (Cinematic Mode,</div><div>Pause all Units, and Apply Camera), then a Preview Camera Motion box</div><div>should appear to the right of the screen. &nbsp;Use this to view the</div><div>movement of your camera.</div><div><br></div><div>As of right now, the entire trigger should look like this:</div><div><br></div><div>Cinematic 1</div><div>-----------</div><div>Events</div><div>&nbsp; Map Initialization</div><div>Conditions</div><div>Actions</div><div>Actions</div><div>&nbsp; Cinematic - Turn Cinematic Mode On for (All Players)</div><div>&nbsp; Unit - Pause all units</div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Apply CAMERA1 &nbsp;for Player 1 (Red) over 5.00 seconds</div><div><br></div><div>Now, if you Preview the camera, that should clear up any camera motion</div><div>confusion you might have. Before you place the next Apply Camera (so</div><div>it will move to CAMERA2), there is one more Action you will need to</div><div>apply. &nbsp;It is the Wait action, and is the first one availiable in the</div><div>Action menu. &nbsp;Place that directly under the Apply Camera. &nbsp;This</div><div>prevents the camera from moving to fast on you. &nbsp;The Wait action&nbsp;</div><div>should look like this:</div><div><br></div><div>Wait 5.00 seconds</div><div><br></div><div>As a rule of thumb for right now, you should change the 2.00 part (how</div><div>long it will wait) to however long your camera is. &nbsp;This will make it</div><div>nice and smooth. &nbsp;See how your Apply Camera has the \"...over 5.00</div><div>seconds\" part? &nbsp;Well make the Wait 5.00 seconds too. [Editor: Once in</div><div>a while, the camera's movement may be very staggered. In this case, it</div><div>may be that the cameras are arriving to their new spot ahead of time.</div><div>To remedy this, either increase the apply time or decrease the wait</div><div>time.]</div><div><br></div><div>Now you can place the next Apply Camera, and another Wait after that,</div><div>and the last of the Apply Cameras. &nbsp;In total, the whole thing should</div><div>look like this:</div><div><br></div><div>Cinematic 1</div><div>-----------</div><div>Events</div><div>&nbsp; Map Initialization</div><div>Conditions</div><div>Actions</div><div>Actions</div><div>&nbsp; Cinematic - Turn Cinematic Mode On for (All Players)</div><div>&nbsp; Unit - Pause all units</div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Apply CAMERA1 &nbsp;for Player 1 (Red) over 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Wait 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Apply CAMERA2 &nbsp;for Player 1 (Red) over 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Wait 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Apply CAMERA3 &nbsp;for Player 1 (Red) over 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Wait 5.00 seconds</div><div><br></div><div>Preview the camera motion, and you should see the whole cinematic</div><div>running smoothly and on time. &nbsp;The camera will start in front of the</div><div>unit, and revolve around it, ending up on its \"back\" side. Before you</div><div>can say this is a complete trigger, there are still a few things you</div><div>have to add. &nbsp;Remember how you placed the Cinematic - Turn Cinematic</div><div>Mode On function? &nbsp;Well, you have to place another Action at the end</div><div>of the trigger turning it off, or the game will just stay in Cinematic</div><div>Mode the whole game, leaving you unable to do anything. &nbsp;You should</div><div>also place a Unit - Unpause all units Action. &nbsp;The complete result of</div><div>all this should look like this:</div><div><br></div><div>Cinematic 1</div><div>-----------</div><div>Events</div><div>&nbsp; Map Initialization</div><div>Conditions</div><div>Actions</div><div>Actions</div><div>&nbsp; Cinematic - Turn Cinematic Mode On for (All Players)</div><div>&nbsp; Unit - Pause all units</div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Apply CAMERA1 &nbsp;for Player 1 (Red) over 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Wait 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Apply CAMERA2 &nbsp;for Player 1 (Red) over 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Wait 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Apply CAMERA3 &nbsp;for Player 1 (Red) over 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Wait 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Unit - Unpause all units</div><div>&nbsp; Cinematic - Turn Cinematic Mode Off for (All Players)</div><div><br></div><div>You have now created your first real Cinematic, congratulations!</div><div><br></div><div>However, you can't be done yet, can you? &nbsp;If you have viewed this in</div><div>the actual game (via Test Map [Editor: The shortcut is Ctrl+F9.]),</div><div>you'll probably notice it doesn't look very good. &nbsp;First off, the</div><div>camera has moved into a different position. &nbsp;Right now, it probably</div><div>doesn't look very weird, but what would happen if the camera was</div><div>placed on the ground at a tilt? &nbsp;That would make it pretty hard to</div><div>move the unit, wouldn't it? &nbsp;Therefore, you should always placed yet</div><div>another Action at the end of a cinematic trigger. &nbsp;This Action is the</div><div>Camera - Reset Game Camera. &nbsp;The Action should look like this:</div><div><br></div><div>Camera - Reset camera for Player 1 (Red) to standard game-view over</div><div>&nbsp; 2.00 seconds</div><div><br></div><div>This moves the screen back to the original \"overhead\" view. &nbsp;The</div><div>action itself is pretty self-explanatory. &nbsp;Add this in and the whole</div><div>thing should be:</div><div><br></div><div>Cinematic 1</div><div>-----------</div><div>Events</div><div>&nbsp; Map Initialization</div><div>Conditions</div><div>Actions</div><div>Actions</div><div>&nbsp; Cinematic - Turn Cinematic Mode On for (All players)</div><div>&nbsp; Unit - Pause all units</div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Apply CAMERA1 &nbsp;for Player 1 (Red) over 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Wait 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Apply CAMERA2 &nbsp;for Player 1 (Red) over 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Wait 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Apply CAMERA3 &nbsp;for Player 1 (Red) over 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Wait 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; Unit - Unpause all units</div><div>&nbsp; Cinematic - Turn Cinematic Mode Off for (All players)</div><div>&nbsp; Camera - Reset camera for Player 1 (Red) to standard game-view over</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.00 seconds</div><div><br></div><div>Now, this will make it look a bit better, but the cinematic still</div><div>isn't complete. &nbsp;You probably want add conversations, right? &nbsp;You want</div><div>a unit to be talking to you? &nbsp;Well, the next section should explain&nbsp;</div><div>that, as well as others...</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Optional Camera Triggers</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>Assuming you now have a basic cinematic up, I'm sure you would like to</div><div>add a little more to it to give it a higher quality, right? &nbsp;Well,</div><div>there are many more Actions availiable to help you do that. &nbsp;The first&nbsp;</div><div>I'll discuss will be the Cinematic - Transmission from Unit action.</div><div>This is what allows you to be spoken to by a unit during a cinematic.</div><div>Their head will appear on the bottom right of the screen, and their</div><div>text speech will appear along the bottom section, just like in Single</div><div>Player. &nbsp;The action should look like this:</div><div><br></div><div>Cinematic - Send transmission to (All Players) from Unit named Name:</div><div>&nbsp; Play No sound and display Message. Modify duration: Add 0.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; and Wait.</div><div><br></div><div>The conditions here are:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; (All Players) - You know what this is</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Unit - You can manually chose which unit will be speaking to you.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please note that you need to actually have the unit speaking</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; somewhere on the map, or a blank space will be shown instead of</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; their face.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Name - The name that will be shown for the unit sending the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; transmission to you,</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; No sound - This is where you can add a sound to play while they</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; speak. &nbsp;If, for instance, you create your own voice acting, you</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; can add that here. [Editor: MP3 format is highly recommended over</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; the WAV format.]</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Message - What the unit will be saying, and the message will appear</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; on the bottom section of the screen.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Add - This either adds, subtracts, or sets the length of the message</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; to whatever you choose in the next condition.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; 0.00 - This is the length of what you chose in the last condition.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Use this and the above condition to change the length of your</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; transmission.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Wait - This can be either Wait or Don't Wait, which makes it wait</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; until the message is done to continue with the trigger.</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>You should probably place this one directly infront of the camera</div><div>action, so it will play the transmission as soon as the camera moves.</div><div><br></div><div>Another useful Action for cinematics is the Cinematic - Fade Filter.</div><div>This allows the screen to fade in and out, creating a nice transition</div><div>affect from one camera to the next.</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>Cinematic - Fade in and back out over 2.00 seconds using texture White</div><div>Mask and color</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;(0.00, 0.00, 0.00) with 0.00% transparency</div><div><br></div><div>And here are the availiable fields to adjust...</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Fade in and back out - This is how the screen will fade. &nbsp;It can</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Fade in and back out, Fade out, or Fade in.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; 2.00 - This is how long the screen will fade out/in for. &nbsp;If you set</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; it at 5.00 seconds it will slowly grow darker for 5.00 seconds</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; until it matches the color you chose in the next field.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; White Mask - This is what the screen will fade to. &nbsp;It can be many</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; different screens, but the main one you will probably be using for</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; a nice fade affect will be Black Mask, which turns the screen</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; black (obviously).</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; (0.00, 0.00, 0.00) - This affects the tinting of the fade screen.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The colors are (Red, Green, Blue). &nbsp;Adjust the fields to make the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fade texture more of one color. &nbsp;The higher the number, the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;higher the tinting will be.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; 0.00% - Adjust this field to affect how transparent the fade will</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; be. The higher the value (up to 100), the more you will be able to</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; see through the &nbsp;fade screen.</div><div><br></div><div>Again, this is used nicely for transitions from one camera to the</div><div>next, but because of the numerous fade screens available, there are</div><div>many different uses for the Fade Filter. &nbsp;Experiment with them and see</div><div>which one is right for your map.</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>Another useful Action is Cinematic - Enable User Control and</div><div>Cinematic - Disable User Control. &nbsp;These make it so you cannot control</div><div>your units during a cinematic, which is understandably useful.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Disable User Control for (All Players)</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Enable User Control for (All Players)</div><div><br></div><div>The only fields adjustable here are (All Players), which you already</div><div>know of. Just remember, if you do place a Cinematic - Disable User</div><div>Control, place it at the beginning of the trigger, and place a</div><div>Cinematic - Enable User Control at the end, or you won't be able to</div><div>continue the game after the cinematic ends.</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>There are, of course, many more Actions you can use to spice up your</div><div>movie, but for now, these are the basics. &nbsp;My best advice would be to</div><div>look at each Action and see what they do in the real game. &nbsp;Most of</div><div>them are pretty self-explanatory.</div><div><br></div><div>Example Cinematics</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>In this section you can download complete, working cinematics to give</div><div>examples of the various triggers I have been talking about.</div><div><br></div><div>If you download any, before you run it, open it with the World Editor.</div><div>Open the Trigger Editor and read the comments I have (in the box at</div><div>the top). &nbsp;Take note of the things mentioned there.</div><div><br></div><div>Download any of these at PinkFloyd1965's website (see the top of the</div><div>FAQ).</div><div><br></div><div>Here is a list of what each download has</div><div>and what Actions are used.</div><div><br></div><div>Archimonde vs Mannoroth - This is the basic use of cameras. It shows</div><div>&nbsp; several different views of Archimonde fighting Mannoroth. It shows</div><div>&nbsp; the use of the Fade Filter as well as Camera - Reset Game View.</div><div><br></div><div>Archer vs Grunt - An Archer faces off against a Grunt. Actions used</div><div>&nbsp; here are the Transmission from Unit and Pause All Units.</div><div><br></div><div>Siege - This shows off the more \"fancy\" uses of the Fade In/Out</div><div>&nbsp; Action, as well as a few other triggers not needed for Cinematics.</div><div>&nbsp; I also threw in the Pick Every Player action.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>|| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;N E W &nbsp; S E C T I O N &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ||</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>Terrain and Map-Building:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;|\\ &nbsp; | _ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _ &nbsp; &nbsp;_ &nbsp; &nbsp;____ &nbsp;/ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;| \\ &nbsp;|/_\\ &nbsp;_ &nbsp;| | &nbsp;/ \\ &nbsp;/ &nbsp;| &nbsp; \\ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;| &nbsp;\\ | &nbsp; &nbsp;/ &nbsp; |\\ &nbsp;| &nbsp;| &nbsp;\\ &nbsp;| &nbsp; / &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;| &nbsp; \\|\\__| &nbsp; &nbsp;| \\__\\/ &nbsp; /__|__/ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\___| &nbsp; &nbsp; \\__/ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>NECROSIS</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>The Terrain Editor</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>The Terrain Editor is one of the most important tools in making any</div><div>kind of map. In order to make a good looking map you need to plan</div><div>ahead, or even lay out your ideas on a piece of paper. That having</div><div>been said lets start with the basics. When you create a new map,</div><div>you’ll see a window appear. You will be able to choose from many</div><div>different options:</div><div><br></div><div>Map Size</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; One of the most important options. This will decide how big your map</div><div>&nbsp; is. 64x64 is the smallest, and 190x190 is the largest. You can even</div><div>&nbsp; have a map that is 64X190 is you want to. Choose your map size</div><div>&nbsp; wisely.</div><div><br></div><div>Playable Area</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; This tells you how much of the map is playable. If you have a 64X64</div><div>&nbsp; map, only 52X52 of the area would be playable.</div><div><br></div><div>Size Description</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; This tells you whether your map is tiny, small, medium, or large.</div><div><br></div><div>The Tileset</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; This is another Important one. This decides what your map will look</div><div>&nbsp; like. The initial Tileset is Lordaeron Summer. This tileset has</div><div>&nbsp; its own unique tiles. Look at each one to see which one fits your</div><div>&nbsp; map.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; [Editor: Certain programs, such as the Xtra Editor and W3Z Map</div><div>&nbsp; Editor, currently in beta, allow you to create your own custom</div><div>&nbsp; tileset, including different cliff tiles.]</div><div><br></div><div>Initial Cliff Level</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; The cliff level tells you how high or low your map is. The initial</div><div>&nbsp; cliff level is 2, allowing you to make deep water and raise the</div><div>&nbsp; ground level. If you have it at 0 you wont be able to lower the</div><div>&nbsp; ground at all, but will be able to raise the ground level greatly.</div><div>&nbsp; If you raise the cliff level to 14, you will not be able to raise</div><div>&nbsp; the ground but will be able to lower the ground greatly.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; NOTE: You will learn how to raise or lower the ground later in this</div><div>&nbsp; FAQ.</div><div><br></div><div>Initial Water</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; This gives you the option of covering the whole map with ground,</div><div>&nbsp; shallow water, or deep water. The initial setting is ground.</div><div><br></div><div>Random Height Field</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; If you select this checkbox you will find that your map has, well,</div><div>&nbsp; random heights. It isn’t very useful, and doesn’t look very good in</div><div>&nbsp; my opinion, but if you want to apply this texture I wont stop you!</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>*Now that you have selected all the beginning options you need to know</div><div>how to actually make your map. You’ll see a window on the side that</div><div>has all the terrain editing tools you need. Each tool is very useful:</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Apply Texture</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; This is the different types of tiles you can have. If you wanted to</div><div>&nbsp; make a desert, you would make a dirt area. In order to select the</div><div>&nbsp; tile of your choice, just click the Apply Texture box and select any</div><div>&nbsp; of the tiles that pleases you.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Blight</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you haven’t played as Undead yet you wouldn’t know what blight</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; is. This is like corrupted ground that the undead can build on.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Add Boundary</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This creates a black wall that disables you to walk in that area.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; [Editor: Note, though, that units can still see across these</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; boundaries if they are in the map itself. You need to place</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Line of Sight Blockers (doodads) in order to prevent this if it</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; would have a negative effect on your map, specifically an RPG.]</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Remove Boundary</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This removes the boundary from the map.</div><div><br></div><div>Apply Cliff &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; One of the more important ones. This allows you to raise or lower</div><div>&nbsp; the terrain grounds. It even allows you apply water or ramps. Here</div><div>&nbsp; are some of the options you have:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Decrease Two</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;This lowers the ground by 2 cliff levels.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Decrease One</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This lowers the ground by 1 cliff level.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Same Level</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Very useful for making big areas of water, cliffs, or gaps in the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; ground. The way to using this effectively is selecting a cliff,</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; and dragging it across a lower/higher level of terrain. You’ll see</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; the results.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Increase One</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This raises the ground by 1 cliff level.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Increase Two</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This raises the ground by 2 cliff levels.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Deep Water</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is deep water. You cannot place any units in deep water</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; areas. (Lowers the ground by 2 cliff levels.)</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Shallow Water</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is shallow water. You can place units in shallow water areas</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; if you wish. (Lowers the ground by 1 cliff level.)</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ramp</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is sort of a conversion between different height levels.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In order to place a ramp you must make a suitable area for a</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cliff, then try to click on the area you want the cliff to show</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;up. It can get annoying, but if you work at it you’ll get a cliff</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to show up.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[Editor: Assume that there are two ground level. One is at a</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;height of 3, the other is at a height of 4. Follow this diagram:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; /-------------\\</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; | 4 4 4 3 3 3 | The 4 represents the ground with a cliff level of</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; | 4 4 4 3 3 3 | 4, and the 3 represents a cliff level of 3. The</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; | 4 4 4 3 3 3 | only way to create a ramp between these two</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; | 4 4 4 3 3 3 | heights is shown below...</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; | 4 4 4 3 3 3 |</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; | 4 4 4 3 3 3 |</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; \\-------------/</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; /-------------\\</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; | 4 4 4 3 3 3 | The R indicates a ramp.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; | 4 4 4 3 3 3 |</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; | 4 4 R R 3 3 |</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; | 4 4 R R 3 3 |</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; | 4 4 4 3 3 3 |</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; | 4 4 4 3 3 3 |</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; \\-------------/ ]</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; NOTE: Cliffs can appear to be strange looking, so if you find out</div><div>&nbsp; that that is happening, just make a bigger area for you to apply the</div><div>&nbsp; cliff.</div><div><br></div><div>Cliff Type &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; You can change the type of cliff you want in your map if you need a</div><div>&nbsp; different matching cliff type. Beware though, if you combine these</div><div>&nbsp; 2 types of cliffs into 1 cliff it will not look good at all.</div><div><br></div><div>Apply Height</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Very useful in many cases. This gradually raises/lowers the ground.</div><div>&nbsp; Apply to make mountains, gaps, plateaus, etc. etc.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Raise</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;This gradually raises the ground.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Lower</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This Gradually lowers the ground</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Plateau</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is just like the same level tool. It applies ground of the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; same level over lower/higher terrain.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Noise</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This applies pitted ground in the area of your choice.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; [Editor: This can make for all the slight variations in your</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; terrain. In order to give the game a more realistic visual feel,</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; this imitates the randomness of slope variations in real life.]</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Smooth</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This makes the terrain smooth and at ground level. It can be used</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; to get rid of \"noisy\" terrain.</div><div><br></div><div>Size</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Yet another useful tool. Instead of covering the map with very</div><div>&nbsp; little bodies of water, you can cover massive amounts of your map</div><div>&nbsp; with water, ground, cliffs, etc. This tool is incredibly easy to</div><div>&nbsp; figure out, so work at using it and you’ll surely become very good</div><div>&nbsp; at it.</div><div><br></div><div>*Now that we have covered he basic tools of the map editor we need to</div><div>get into he more advanced options, such as doodads, modifying the</div><div>tileset, random variations, etc etc.</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Doodads</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>This is optional, but incredibly useful for making your map look in</div><div>top shape. You can use these to apply rocks, chairs, thrones, walls,</div><div>gates, shrines, etc. You can also add cinematic doodads such as</div><div>fire, lightning, blue fire etc.</div><div><br></div><div>Bridges/Ramps</div><div>&nbsp; This gives you the option to add bridges and ramps to your map.</div><div><br></div><div>Cinematic</div><div>&nbsp; This doodad type lets you add fire, blue fire, lightning, etc.</div><div><br></div><div>Cliff</div><div>&nbsp; This option allows you to create Cliff Caves.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Environment</div><div>&nbsp; This allows you to create environmental doodads such as rocks,</div><div>&nbsp; corn, lily pads, etc. These doodads are a must.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; [Editor: To maximize the effectiveness of these great doodads,</div><div>&nbsp; place them rather sparingly along shorelines, and concentrate</div><div>&nbsp; them in small inlets or ponds. Rocks can be placed with great</div><div>&nbsp; effectiveness near Fountains or ruins.]</div><div><br></div><div>Props</div><div>&nbsp; This lets you add props for a cinematics, for show, or something</div><div>&nbsp; to do with your map.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Structures</div><div>&nbsp; Use these doodads if you want to make a city.</div><div><br></div><div>Trees/Destructibles</div><div>&nbsp; Use these for making trees, gates, cages, etc.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; [Editor: To make forests, use a large size for your Apply Brush.</div><div>&nbsp; In other words, plant several trees at the same time, and drag</div><div>&nbsp; your mouse to outline the tree walls of the forest.]</div><div><br></div><div>Water</div><div>&nbsp; This adds water doodads such as waterfalls, lily pads, etc.</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Modifying the Tileset</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; A very useful feature in the map editor is the ability to modify the</div><div>&nbsp; tileset. This enables you to create your own tileset, and it is</div><div>&nbsp; amazingly easy to use. Heres how to use it. Create a new map, and</div><div>&nbsp; then go to the Modify Tileset option under the Tools/Advanced bar.</div><div>&nbsp; To edit the tileset, check the box that says, \"Use Custom Tileset\".</div><div>&nbsp; In order to combine two different tiles you need to know that you</div><div>&nbsp; can only have a certain amount of tiles. You’ll see that each tile</div><div>&nbsp; takes up a certain amount of \"Tile Space\". The initial tile space is</div><div>&nbsp; 12, so be careful. A tile takes up either 1 or 2 tile spaces. In</div><div>&nbsp; order to add a tile to your map; select a tile from a different map</div><div>&nbsp; type in the additional textures. Once you have selected your</div><div>&nbsp; texture, click on the \"Add Tile\" box. Congratulations! You have your</div><div>&nbsp; very own unique tileset. Now if you want your tileset to be in order,</div><div>&nbsp; you can shift the tile right or left by clicking on the Shift Right/</div><div>&nbsp; Shift Left boxes. It doesn’t really matter much, but if you’re picky</div><div>&nbsp; then go ahead.</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Things to Remember</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>Use your doodad</div><div>&nbsp; Remember, use all your doodads! Select various doodads and put them</div><div>&nbsp; in the fitting location. You need to know where to put them, or else</div><div>&nbsp; your map won't look good.</div><div><br></div><div>Too much water is BAD</div><div>&nbsp; Do NOT fill more than 1/4 of your map with water! You need to use</div><div>&nbsp; your entire map effectively! Make everything have a tight fit, so</div><div>&nbsp; you can have a longer RPG, Melee Map, Custom Map etc.</div><div><br></div><div>Make various cliff levels</div><div>&nbsp; Try to use the raise cliff tool. You need to make obstacles in your</div><div>&nbsp; map, and making higher ground levels is the key to doing so.</div><div><br></div><div>Trees</div><div>&nbsp; Trees can just be like water. Don’t waste your map on Trees, they</div><div>&nbsp; will just add more and more useless doodads to your map.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>|| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;N E W &nbsp; S E C T I O N &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ||</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>MPQ Editing, Unit Editor:</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;---</div><div>&nbsp; \\ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; __ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /|</div><div>&nbsp;--- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; / &nbsp;\\ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; / |</div><div>&nbsp;|- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ( &nbsp; &nbsp;) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; / &nbsp;|</div><div>&nbsp;--- &nbsp; __ &nbsp;/ \\__/ \\ &nbsp;__ &nbsp; &nbsp; |</div><div>&nbsp;--, &nbsp;/ &nbsp;\\/ &nbsp; || &nbsp; \\/ &nbsp;\\ &nbsp; &nbsp;|</div><div>&nbsp;|-' ( &nbsp; &nbsp;)---||---( &nbsp; &nbsp;) &nbsp; |</div><div>&nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp;\\__/| &nbsp; || &nbsp; |\\__/ &nbsp; &nbsp;|</div><div>&nbsp;- - &nbsp; || | &nbsp; || &nbsp; | || &nbsp;___|____</div><div>&nbsp;|-| &nbsp; __ &nbsp;\\ &nbsp;|| &nbsp;/ &nbsp;__ &nbsp; ______</div><div>&nbsp;- - &nbsp;/ &nbsp;\\ &nbsp;\\ || / &nbsp;/ &nbsp;\\ / &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\</div><div>&nbsp;--- ( &nbsp; &nbsp;)--\\__/--( &nbsp; &nbsp;)| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|</div><div>&nbsp; | &nbsp; \\__/ \\ / &nbsp;\\ / \\__/ | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|</div><div>&nbsp;--- &nbsp; || &nbsp; ( &nbsp; &nbsp;) &nbsp; || &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|</div><div>&nbsp;|-` &nbsp; __ &nbsp;/ \\__/ \\ &nbsp;__ &nbsp;| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|</div><div>&nbsp;|-' &nbsp;/ &nbsp;\\/ &nbsp; || &nbsp; \\/ &nbsp;\\ \\______/</div><div>&nbsp;| \\ ( &nbsp; &nbsp;)--------( &nbsp; &nbsp;)</div><div>&nbsp;/-\\ &nbsp;\\__/ \\ &nbsp;__ &nbsp;/ \\__/ &nbsp; /|</div><div>&nbsp;| | &nbsp; &nbsp;\\ &nbsp; \\/ &nbsp;\\/ &nbsp; / &nbsp; &nbsp;/ |</div><div>&nbsp;\\-/ &nbsp; &nbsp; \\ &nbsp;( &nbsp; &nbsp;) &nbsp;/ &nbsp; &nbsp;/ &nbsp;|</div><div>&nbsp;--- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\ &nbsp;\\__/ &nbsp;/ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|</div><div>&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\\ &nbsp;__ &nbsp;/ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |</div><div>&nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\/ &nbsp;\\/ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|</div><div>&nbsp;- - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;( &nbsp; &nbsp;) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|</div><div>&nbsp;|-| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \\__/ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;___|____</div><div>&nbsp;- -</div><div><br></div><div>SEPHIROTH101</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>The Unit Editor</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>First of all, this portion of the FAW is going to list things in the</div><div>advanced world editor. I will list a few things that may be different</div><div>between the normal editor, and advanced editor.</div><div><br></div><div>It helps if you download and install the editor from</div><div>www.wc3campaigns.com [Editor: World Editor Enhanced Blink]</div><div><br></div><div>To get into the unit editor, press F6 at any time whole World Editor</div><div>is loaded. First of all, you can press CONTROL+N to create a new unit.</div><div>This unit will use the stats of whatever unit it is based off of, and</div><div>you cannot create a new unit based off a custom unit.</div><div><br></div><div>The editor IS limited to around 90 or so custom units...</div><div><br></div><div>Lets go through the basic fields that you can see:</div><div><br></div><div>Name</div><div>&nbsp; Lists the name for the unit. If it is a hero, this is the name of</div><div>&nbsp; the type of hero.</div><div>Name-Editor Suffix</div><div>&nbsp; This is used by the World Editor only. &nbsp;It is helpful when telling</div><div>&nbsp; the difference between similar units, like the Owl Scouts.</div><div>Proper Names</div><div>&nbsp; Used to give the hero names. The game will pick a random proper name</div><div>&nbsp; for the hero when the hero is created. If multiple heros with the</div><div>&nbsp; same name are created, they will have names like Bob, Bob II, Bob</div><div>&nbsp; III and Bob XII, ect.</div><div>Model Used</div><div>&nbsp; In the normal editor, you can click on the picture of a unit to</div><div>&nbsp; decide what you want its actual 3D model to look like. In the</div><div>&nbsp; advanced editor, this is a string that can be changed to the</div><div>&nbsp; location of the 3D model in the war3.mpq.</div><div>Required Animation Names</div><div>&nbsp; Used by the game to know how to change a unit. Used by units that</div><div>&nbsp; \"upgrade\" and \"morph\". For instance, in order for a tower to be</div><div>&nbsp; upgradable into a cannon tower, it MUST have the upgrade and second</div><div>&nbsp; animation names, so the game knows how and what it upgrades into.</div><div>Interface Icon</div><div>&nbsp; In the normal editor this is another click-on-the-picture method of</div><div>&nbsp; selection. This is the actual graphical icon the game uses for the</div><div>&nbsp; unit, like when you click to build it, when it is in a sub-group,</div><div>&nbsp; etc. In the advanced editor, this is a string from the war3.mpq.</div><div>Scaling Value</div><div>&nbsp; This determines the unit's size from its normal size when it was</div><div>&nbsp; created in a 3D model creating program, like Gmax [Editor: gmax is</div><div>&nbsp; excellent 3D modelling freeware. Its URL is discreet.com.]. 1.00 for</div><div>&nbsp; a value indicates its normal size when it was created. A number</div><div>&nbsp; below 1.00 in decimal form will decrease the unit's size in</div><div>&nbsp; proportion to its normal size. Going above 1.00 has the opposite</div><div>&nbsp; effect. The Lowest value is .10 and the highest is 999999.0.</div><div>Tinting Value (Red, Green, Blue)</div><div>&nbsp; OK, this determines the units actual coloration, NOT its TEAM color.</div><div>&nbsp; To pick a color, open up a program like MS Paint. Go into</div><div>&nbsp; Colors -&gt; Edit Colors..., then click on Define Custom Colors &gt;&gt; and</div><div>&nbsp; on that spectrum of 16 bit colors, select one. On the bottom right</div><div>&nbsp; corner of the custom color picker, there are the RGB color values!</div><div>&nbsp; Pop these same numbers into Warcraft III and bam, the unit WILL be</div><div>&nbsp; that exact coloration. [Editor: Do note that you cannot make units</div><div>&nbsp; any whiter than they already are. The RGB for all standard units is</div><div>&nbsp; (255, 255, 255)</div><div>Collision Size</div><div>&nbsp; This will determine the size, in Warcraft III metric units, that</div><div>&nbsp; this unit is \"solid\". That means if this number is 0, you can pass</div><div>&nbsp; right through this unit. This usually does not need to be messed</div><div>&nbsp; with. A rule of thumb is to scale this value proportionally with the</div><div>&nbsp; scaling value.</div><div>Pathing Map</div><div>&nbsp; This is the texture that appears under the unit, such as a building.</div><div>&nbsp; This may NOT be left blank. The value is a string to the pathing map</div><div>&nbsp; in the war3.mpq. Some sample textures are:</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; PathTextures\\12x12Simple.tga &nbsp; &nbsp;- Texture under barracks; Medium</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; PathTextures\\4x4SimpleSolid.tga - Texture under towers; Smallest</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; PathTextures\\16x16Goldmine.tga &nbsp;- Texture under goldmine; Largest</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; PathTextures\\6x6unbuildable.tga - Can be walked upon; no collision</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; PathTextures\\8x8Round.tga &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Texture under specials; Round</div><div>&nbsp; These are all non-scalable so you need to find one that matches your</div><div>&nbsp; size. You cannot build on top of a texture under a building, so</div><div>&nbsp; Tower Defense maps typically use a 4x4 simple solid on all their</div><div>&nbsp; towers, because this allows the towers to be neatly arranged, and</div><div>&nbsp; close together.</div><div>Selection Scale</div><div>&nbsp; This is the size of the circle that appears around a selected unit.</div><div>&nbsp; Usually this has to be scaled in proportion to the scaling value,</div><div>&nbsp; but it can be left alone.</div><div>Gold Cost</div><div>&nbsp; This is the amount, in gold resources, that the unit costs to be</div><div>&nbsp; built, bought at a shop, etc.</div><div>Lumber Cost</div><div>&nbsp; This is the amount, in lumber resources, that the unit costs to be</div><div>&nbsp; built, bought at a shop, etc.</div><div>Supply Cost</div><div>&nbsp; This is how much food the unit uses. It can be set to zero.</div><div>Supply Produced</div><div>&nbsp; This is how much food the unit produces [Editor: This is intended</div><div>&nbsp; for units like Farms or Ziggurats.]. It can be set from 0 to 90.</div><div>Unit Classification</div><div>&nbsp; In the normal editor, this is a list of classes that can be checked</div><div>&nbsp; off. Making it \"mechanical\" makes it repairable, but unhealable.</div><div>&nbsp; Making it \"undead\" means it can be injured by holy light. Making it</div><div>&nbsp; \"peon\" lets it go into Orc Burrows, etc. In the advanced editor,</div><div>&nbsp; this is usually a string, with multiple unit classes being</div><div>&nbsp; separated by a comma and one space. [Editor: For example, you could</div><div>&nbsp; write \"peon, undead\".]</div><div>Build Time</div><div>&nbsp; This is the time the unit takes to build, in seconds. This may be</div><div>&nbsp; more or less depending on the game speed.</div><div>Hitpoints: Maximum Base</div><div>&nbsp; These are the max hitpoints that the unit can have at any time, not</div><div>&nbsp; including upgrades. It can be set to extremely high and low numbers.</div><div>&nbsp; [Editor: It may also increase when heroes obtain or use certain</div><div>&nbsp; items.]</div><div>Hitpoints: Regeneration Rate</div><div>&nbsp; These are how mnay hitpoints the unit will recover per second. When</div><div>&nbsp; used with heros, the hero's Strength is added to this number as he</div><div>&nbsp; levels up, because Strength makes heros regenerate.</div><div>Hitpoints: Regeneration Type</div><div>&nbsp; This is how the unit regenerates. It can be set to \"none\", \"always\",</div><div>&nbsp; \"at nighttime\", \"at daytime\", or \"while standing on blight\". Even if</div><div>&nbsp; set on none, all heros will regenerate if they have at least 1</div><div>&nbsp; Strength.</div><div>Mana: Maximum</div><div>&nbsp; This is the most mana the unit can have at any time without a single</div><div>&nbsp; upgrade.</div><div>Mana: Regeneration</div><div>&nbsp; This is the amount of mana that is restored naturally each second.</div><div>Mana: Initial</div><div>&nbsp; This is how much mana the unit has when it is produced. This is</div><div>&nbsp; usually kept low to prevent new units from using powerful high-mana</div><div>&nbsp; spells too early, like Possession or Polymorph.</div><div>Requirements</div><div>&nbsp; These are the units that need to be built in order for this unit to</div><div>&nbsp; be built. If kept blank, the unit can be built by default.</div><div>Trained Units</div><div>&nbsp; These are the units that this unit can train. Build time is factored</div><div>&nbsp; in when training units. This is typically kept strictly to</div><div>&nbsp; structures.</div><div>Units Sold</div><div>&nbsp; These are any units sold in the same way that a Mercenary Camp sells</div><div>&nbsp; units. Unit stock, gold cost, and time interval are all considered</div><div>&nbsp; for the unit being sold.</div><div>Items Sold</div><div>&nbsp; These are any items that are sold in the same way that a Goblin</div><div>&nbsp; Merchant might sell items. Gold cost, stock, and interval all are</div><div>&nbsp; factored into this.</div><div>Upgrades Used</div><div>&nbsp; These are all the upgrades that this unit will use. These upgrades</div><div>&nbsp; have to be researched before the unit will take advantage of them.</div><div>Structures Built</div><div>&nbsp; These are a list of structures that the unit is able to create from</div><div>&nbsp; the ground up. The unit does not have to be classified as a peon,</div><div>&nbsp; BUT, the unit MUST HAVE the Repair ability to build a structure.</div><div>Defense Base</div><div>&nbsp; This is the amount of armor a unit has when it is first produced in</div><div>&nbsp; a building, with no upgrades at all.</div><div>Defense Upgrade Bonus</div><div>&nbsp; This is how much armor the unit gains with each armor upgrade.</div><div>Defense Type</div><div>&nbsp; This is the type of armor that the unit uses.</div><div>Minimum Attack Range</div><div>&nbsp; This is how far away from the target a unit has to be in oder to hit</div><div>&nbsp; it. If a target is within the range specified, then the unit will</div><div>&nbsp; not be able to attack. This can be set to 0.</div><div>Attacks Enabled</div><div>&nbsp; This tells the game what attacks the unit uses. This can be set to</div><div>&nbsp; None in order to make the unit have no attack. It can also be set to</div><div>&nbsp; Attack 1 and Both. A unit may only have up to two attacks. The unit</div><div>&nbsp; will automatically use the attack that deals the most damage to the</div><div>&nbsp; enemy. This takes into consideration damage, armor, etc.</div><div>Attack Range</div><div>&nbsp; This is how far the unit is able to shoot a projectile. A number</div><div>&nbsp; under 101 is considered a melee attack, and the unit will have to</div><div>&nbsp; stand right next to the enemy to damage him. This can be set up to</div><div>&nbsp; 22000.</div><div>Attack Type</div><div>&nbsp; This is the type of attack that is used by thr unit. If this is set</div><div>&nbsp; to Spell, it will use Spell statistics. Normal units usually take</div><div>&nbsp; 100% damage from spells, and heros take 50-75% reduced spell damage.</div><div>Attack Weapon Type</div><div>&nbsp; This is the type of \"gun\" the unit uses. I will describe each one:</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Normal &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - A normal attack used for melee</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Instant &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Makes the projectile instantly hit its target</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i.e. Rifleman).</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Artillery &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Shoots a shell at the target that can be</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dodged (i.e. Mortar Team).</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Artillery (Line) - Shoots a shell close to the ground that can be</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dodged (i.e. Ballista with Impaling Bolt).</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Missile &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Shoots a projectile that follows its target</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(i.e. Priest)</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Missile (Splash) - Shoots a missle the follows closely and</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;splashes (i.e. Demon Hunter in Demon Form).</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Missile (Bounce) - Shoots a missle that follows and bounces off</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;enemies (i.e. Huntress).</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Missile (Line) &nbsp; - Shoots a missle that slightly follows.</div><div>Projectile Art</div><div>&nbsp; In the normal editor, this is a selectable picture of the unit that</div><div>&nbsp; you want your unit's attack to look like. In the advanced editor,</div><div>&nbsp; this is a string and is located in war3.mpq. With the advanced</div><div>&nbsp; editor, you can use previously unused attacks in the game too.</div><div>Projectile Speed</div><div>&nbsp; This is how fast the projectile that you shoot goes. It is measured</div><div>&nbsp; in Warcraft III metric units per second. 800 metric units is how far</div><div>&nbsp; an orc tower shoots, just to give you a general idea. It can be set</div><div>&nbsp; so slow, it crawls, or so fast, that is is instant.</div><div>Targets Allowed</div><div>&nbsp; These are the types of units that your attack will be able to hit.</div><div>&nbsp; Checking off only \"Hero\" means you can ONLY target heros. Checking</div><div>&nbsp; off \"Ground\" enables you to hit ANY ground unit. Checking off</div><div>&nbsp; \"Ground\" and \"Enemy\" forces the unit to be unable to hit themselves</div><div>&nbsp; or their allies.</div><div>Damage Base</div><div>&nbsp; This is the amount of damage the unit can deal in one normal hit.</div><div>Damage: Number of Dice</div><div>&nbsp; This is a randomness factor added to the damage base. It should be</div><div>&nbsp; kept to 1 or 2 for sake of simplicity.</div><div>Damage: Sides per Die</div><div>&nbsp; This is the damage base, + or - this number. So if damage base is</div><div>&nbsp; 75, and this is 35, your damage will be +25 and-25 the base damage,</div><div>&nbsp; so you will do roughly 50-100 damage with that example.</div><div>Cooldown Time</div><div>&nbsp; This is how many attacks your unit can pull of per second. This</div><div>&nbsp; number is limited depending on how complicated the unit's attack</div><div>&nbsp; animation is.</div><div>Area of Effect: Full, Half, Quarter</div><div>&nbsp; This is the radius, in a circle, around the area of impact that</div><div>&nbsp; units will take full damage. This is used to calculate splash</div><div>&nbsp; damage. The number is in Warcraft III metric units. So if this was</div><div>&nbsp; 800, then every unit within about an Orc Watch Tower's range from</div><div>&nbsp; the impact will take full damage. You can also specify amounts if</div><div>&nbsp; you want half or quarter splash damage.</div><div>Area of Effect: Targets</div><div>&nbsp; These are the units that will be affected by the splash damage. By</div><div>&nbsp; checking off \"Enemy\", you can prevent your own units from killing</div><div>&nbsp; themselves from AOE (area of effect) damage.</div><div>Abilities</div><div>&nbsp; These are all the abilities (usually researchable) that the unit can</div><div>&nbsp; use. These include harvesting gold, repairing, ect.</div><div>Caster Upgrade Names</div><div>&nbsp; These are the classes of caster names. These can be changed as seen</div><div>&nbsp; fit. Usually is composed of three caster names, each corresponding</div><div>&nbsp; to that units degree of training, like \"Initiate\", \"Adept\", and</div><div>&nbsp; \"Master\".</div><div>Caster Upgrade Tips</div><div>&nbsp; When you hover over the caster name of a unit, this is what tells</div><div>&nbsp; the game to display what spells that caster can use at each upgrade</div><div>&nbsp; level of caster training.</div><div>Caster Upgrade Art</div><div>&nbsp; This is the art used to show the level of training for a caster.</div><div>Targeted As</div><div>&nbsp; This is what the unit is targeted as to the enemy. Can be set to</div><div>&nbsp; fields like \"Air\" or \"Ground\".</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>The MPQ File Format</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>&nbsp; MPQ [Editor: pronounced MoPaQ], what is it, you ask? .mpq files are</div><div>how Blizzard archives most of their games. The .mpq files store all</div><div>the info about Warcraft that Blizzard does not want people to mess</div><div>around with. But, by using an MPQ extractor, you can take the files</div><div>out of the .mpq archives and edit them, then put them back in. .mpq</div><div>editing allows you to do things like edit currently existing</div><div>abilities. By editing abilities you can change Tranquility to whatever</div><div>you want it to be. You can make Starfall drop flying sheep instead of</div><div>stars. The possibilites are endless. You can edit the AI scripts and</div><div>create your own. You can change the mini-map of your level to whatever</div><div>you want. You can open up Warcraft III's campaign maps in the editor,</div><div>and see how Blizzard made their maps. But how do you do this you ask?</div><div>Well, it is actually very simple, and I will guide you quickly and</div><div>easily on getting you started.</div><div><br></div><div>First of all, you need a good MPQ Extractor. &nbsp;www.wc3campaigns.com has</div><div>MPQ2k and WinMPQ at their disposal. But which one is better? &nbsp;MPQ2k</div><div>uses as DOS command line, and WinMPQ uses a nice graphical interface.</div><div>I reccomend WinMPQ because of its sheer simplicity and installation.</div><div>When you download WinMPQ, it will install all the files you need</div><div>easily and quickly. Ok, after installing WinMPQ, open it up, and let's</div><div>see the next thing we can do...</div><div><br></div><div>[Editor: TechMPQ is also available, and is my preferred tool. However,</div><div>it will not be explained in this FAQ.]</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; OK, so you have WinMPQ opened up, right? Now, go to File --&gt; Open.</div><div>Go to your Warcraft III directory, which is probably something like</div><div>C:\\Program Files\\Warcraft III or D:\\Program Files\\Warcraft III, and so</div><div>on. What you need to open up in this folder is the file called</div><div>War3.mpq. It takes a little while to open it up, but when it does, we</div><div>get a HUGE list of all the files in the MPQ!</div><div><br></div><div>(NOTE: Backup your war3.mpq file before changing. Also, NEVER delete</div><div>any files from your MPQ unless you put the file there and want to get</div><div>rid of it. If you use WinZip, this setup probably looks familiar.)</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; Ok, as you can see, there are TONS of files here that you can</div><div>extract from the MPQ and use on your own. This program behaves a lot</div><div>like WinZip or WinAce. So, what can you do from here? Many, many</div><div>things. Take a look below.</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Editing Spells and Abilities</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>This one is always something that people want to do [Editor: For those</div><div>who don't know, the normal WE lacks the ability to edit spells or</div><div>abilities.]. Anyways, you want to look for all of the following files</div><div>and extract them to any drive of your choice:</div><div><br></div><div>HumanAbilityFunc.txt</div><div>HumanAbilityStrings.txt</div><div>OrcAbilityFunc.txt</div><div>OrcAbilityStrings.txt</div><div>UndeadAbilityFunc.txt</div><div>UndeadAbilityStrings.txt</div><div>NightelfAbilityFunc.txt</div><div>NightelfAbilityStrings.txt</div><div>NeutalAbilityFunc.txt</div><div>NeutralAbilityStrings.txt</div><div><br></div><div>It can take a while to find these files on this HUGE list of files,</div><div>but, they are somewhat categorized. The files above will be under:</div><div><br></div><div>units\\RACE</div><div><br></div><div>Where the word, RACE, is the race of the file that has the ability you</div><div>want to change. So, you can find the human files under</div><div>units\\human\\HumanAbilityFunc.txt. And so forth. Anyways, when you find</div><div>the files, right-click on them, and click on EXTRACT, then pop them</div><div>into any drive of your choice. It will create a new folder for you</div><div>depending on where the file is in the MPQ. So if you extracted the</div><div>human files above to your C:\\ root, it would now be found now in:</div><div>C:\\Units\\Human\\______.txt, where the ______ is the name of the file.</div><div>Let's go and open up HumanAbilityFunc.txt (find where you extracted it)</div><div>and take a look at the first ability. It should be somehting like this:</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>// Gyrocopter Bombs</div><div>[Agyb]</div><div>Requires=Rhgb</div><div>Art=ReplaceableTextures\\PassiveButtons\\PASBTNHumanArtilleryUpOne.blp</div><div>Buttonpos=1,2</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>Well, you probably have no clue what that all is, so let me explain</div><div>the fields above:</div><div><br></div><div>// NAME &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- That is just a comment. It helps you see what the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ability is.</div><div>[____] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Used by the game to identify the ability.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don't change it.</div><div>Requires= xxxx &nbsp; - More code used by the game. &nbsp;Dont change it.</div><div>Art=xx\\xx\\xx.blp - This is the graphical art of the ability BUTTON.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It shows the location of the art in the war3.mpq.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can change it to whatever you want.</div><div>Buttonpos=x,x &nbsp; &nbsp;- This is where the button is located on the panel.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;See the art below to find out.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; 3</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 &nbsp; x &nbsp; x &nbsp; x &nbsp; x</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 &nbsp; x &nbsp; x &nbsp; x &nbsp; x</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2 &nbsp; x &nbsp; x &nbsp; x &nbsp; x</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first number is the number on top row, the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;second number is on bottom row. These can be</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;changed. So, the Gyrocopter Bombs icon is in the</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;position 1,2. 0,0 is always MOVE. 3,0 is always</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ATTACK, and so forth.</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>Other abilities may have more fields in addition to those. If you</div><div>scroll down the .txt file, you can see many other abilities. Let's</div><div>take a look at BLIZZARD though. We get something like this:</div><div><br></div><div>// Blizzard</div><div>[AHbz]</div><div>Art=ReplaceableTextures\\CommandButtons\\BTNBlizzard.blp</div><div>Researchart=ReplaceableTextures\\CommandButtons\\BTNBlizzard.blp</div><div>Buttonpos=0,2</div><div>Researchbuttonpos=0,0</div><div>Casterart=</div><div>Order=blizzard</div><div><br></div><div>[XHbz]</div><div>Effectart=Abilities\\Spells\\Human\\Blizzard\\BlizzardTarget.mdl</div><div>Effectsoundlooped=BlizzardLoop</div><div>Effectsound=BlizzardWave</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>All right, many, many more fields than in Gyro Bombs. Let's see. The</div><div>Art field is what the button looks like that you have to click on to</div><div>cast blizzard. It can be changed.</div><div><br></div><div>Research art is what the button looks like that you click on to LEARN</div><div>blizzard. This can also be changed. Buttonpos is the position on the</div><div>command button grid (see above), and same with Researchbuttonpos,</div><div>except that's where the button is when you're learning the ability.</div><div><br></div><div>Casterart is anything that might appear over the unit when he is</div><div>casting a spell (like in starfall, runic symbols appear over the</div><div>caster). The order should be blank, and just tells the game what to</div><div>do.</div><div><br></div><div>Further down is the Effectart. This is what the actual SPELL or</div><div>ABILITY looks like. It can be changed to the model of a pig, then pigs</div><div>would rain on the enemies instead of ice shards. The sounds are of</div><div>course just sounds and need to be left alone.</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div><br></div><div>Now, how do you know what these things can be replaced with? &nbsp;Like,</div><div>where do you get the path for a pig? In the MPQ! Remember that long</div><div>list of files? Well, whatever you see in the MPQ list is what you can</div><div>put into these fields (must have the same extension as the original</div><div>field though, like .mdl)</div><div><br></div><div>Well, if you decide to change one of these, to get it into your map</div><div>you have to simply open your map in WinMPQ. Click on ADD files. Find</div><div>your edited .txt. And add it in! That simple. Beware though, whenever</div><div>you save your map in the editor, you have to pop the edited .txt back</div><div>into your map. Putting these files in your map is referred to as</div><div>\"injecting files\".</div><div><br></div><div>Also one last note, the ability files ending in FUNC are to edit its</div><div>actual effects, and the ones eding in STRINGS are the ability</div><div>descrptions. Both files can be modified as much as you want, with</div><div>usually no errors at all. Also, you can only edit existing abilities,</div><div>never make new ones. Try it out! Some suggestions are to make Starfall</div><div>drop sheep, and call it Sheep Fall! Or change Tranquility so it drops</div><div>Rain of Fire meteors! Yuo can do many things with editing those</div><div>ability files!</div><div><br></div><div>*NOTE: &nbsp;Some things can not be changed, like the damage of an ability,</div><div>or if it heals, or how long it lasts. These are hardcoded into the</div><div>game, and cannot be changed by conventional means*</div><div><br></div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>Other MPQ Things</div><div>----------------------------------------------------------------------</div><div>You are not limited to ability editing. Oh no, never! You can open</div><div>map files with WinMPQ and extract the minimap, and make your own</div><div>custom minimap. You can extract the common.ai file from war.mpq and</div><div>make your own AI scripts. You can extract the actual campaigns, and</div><div>edit them, or play them whenever you want. MPQing is one of the great</div><div>things today in WC3 editing, and it allows people to do very advanced</div><div>things. Do not limit yourself to what's in this small tutorial though.</div><div>Explore the MPQ, mess around with files. Almost anything is possible</div><div>with .mpq editing. Good luck with your editing!</div><div><br></div><div>Special Thanks:</div><div>---------------</div><div>Kao Megura (for convincing me to write something helpful)</div><div>Gnollz (giggle :-P )</div><div>Master LL (for never completing his map... like me)</div><div>Warbringer87 (for being a great terrain artist)</div><div>Everyone who contributed to our thread (check the webpage)</div><div>GameFaqs.comfacebook.com/GFAQstwitter.com/GameFAQsHelpSitemapAdvertiseChange Colors&nbsp;</div><div>gamespot.comgiantbomb.commetacritic.comgamerankings.com</div><div>© 2015 CBS Interactive Inc.
